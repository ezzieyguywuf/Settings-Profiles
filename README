This file will eventually be more informative. For now, I will begin
to outline how this project is organizeCreated. Probably some of this
stuff should be stored in the source code files themselves in the form
of comments...

Classes
--------
SettingHandler - Handles settings
Profiles - This class extends the android "Activity" class. It is
           the "Set your profile" activity which pops up when the
           app is started.
myDialogs - A custom class which handles the various pop-up dialogs
            that this app uses.
ProfilesDbHelper - this class in used to write to/from the sqlite
                   database which stores our different setting
                   profiles.
ProfileList - This class also extends the android "Activity" class. It is
              the "Set your profile settings" activity that pops up when
              you wish to edit one of your profiles
MyWidgetProvider - probably has something to do with the widget. This
                   back-burner stuff right now
HelpDialog - I'm assuming this is the Help Dialog Popup. I do not see
             a need to prioritize development on this guy

TODO
-------
(in no particular order)
- update SettingHandler class to account for new things in Android,
  such as "ambient light sensor" option for screen brightness which my
  original code did not need to account for
- update ProfileList to (a) make it less ugly, and (b) make it more
  responsive. Also, should make it more clear wether you are setting a
  profile or editing a profile with your action
- implement "Android Action Bar"
- Review backwards compatibility and how to maintain with updates
- comment code!
- incorporate settings buttons in to "Power Down" dialog, usually
  available by long-pressing power button
- incorporate settings buttons in to lock screen
- incorporate settings buttons in to drop-down
- more?
