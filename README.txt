Welcome to my little corner of the Android Application world. I started this app
because I felt that profiles are sorely needed in Android. Most phone's I have
ever owned have included some sort profiles settings, by which I could easily
switch between different volume settings, screen brightness settings, etc. I
decided to try to make some money while I was at it, hence the 'hey, you can
preview the home screen widget for free but have to pay to actually use it.'
Unfortunately, I haven't had any time to work on this project for close to 6
months now, thus I am open sourcing it. I'm going to take this one step at a
time: I want to clean up my code a little bit, make it easier to read. I think
I'll start a wiki on github as well that outlines the general flow of things
within the program. If you are interested in contributing, please email my at
ezzieyguywuf at gmail dot com, but make sure you put '[Settings Profiles]' in
the subject.
Thanks!
